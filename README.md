# Predictive Modelling for Lung Cancer Treatment Selection Based on Molecular Profile
## Project Overview 
Personalised medicine is transforming healthcare by tailoring treatments to individual patients. In modern precision oncology, for instance, clinicians use a patient’s molecular profile (genomic and proteomic markers) to guide the choice of targeted therapy.

The project has three primary objectives:
- **Predictive Potential of Molecular Profiles:** Determine if and how well molecular profiling data can be used to predict a patient’s treatment type or the optimal therapy choice. In other words, investigate whether patterns in molecular markers correlate strongly enough with treatment outcomes to enable accurate predictions.
- **Comparison of Different Classifiers:** Apply a range of machine learning classification models to the prediction task and evaluate which algorithms perform most effectively. By trying multiple model types, we can identify if certain approaches (e.g., tree-based vs. linear models) are better suited for this biomedical prediction problem.
- **Individual Models vs. Ensemble Approach:** Compare the performance of individually optimised classifiers (each tuned via hyperparameter optimisation) against an ensemble method. The ensemble method, termed `HyperParamEnsemble`, involves training multiple instances of the same type of model with different hyperparameter settings and then combining their predictions by voting. This tests whether aggregating several tuned models of one kind can outperform a single best-tuned model of that kind.

If successful, such a predictive model could become a clinical decision-support tool, helping to verify or even challenge standard treatment recommendations for individual patients. This would mean that, given two or more possible treatments, an algorithm could suggest which one is likely to work best for a specific patient based on their unique biomarker signature.

## Data Description
**Dataset:** The LUAD dataset is derived from the MSK-CHORD (MSK, Nature 2024) cohort, focusing on 4,463 lung adenocarcinoma patients with available treatment records.
